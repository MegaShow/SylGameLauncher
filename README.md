# SylGameLauncher

SylvaX's Game Launcher, shortcut with SylGL.

## Why is it named SylvaX?

SylvaX is my nick name for game.

Also, it can be replaced with SylvaXYZ.

And, this is my another account. [Click](https://github.com/SylvaX)

## How can SylGL do?

In my plan, SylGL is a game launcher with the tool for time counting.

However, now it only supports time counting. Also, it is a little foolish.

Now it is written by NodeJS, but I plan to recode it with C#.

So, please expect its real function!

## How to use?

```shell
# Start the game time counting function
npm run start [Game Name]

# Show the game time list
npm run show
```
